# Harmonized System (HS)

TO DO: Create a copy of the [Supabase SQL insert python](../prep/sql/supabase/) and add HS tables.

Sample use of [Product HS Codes for Georgia Exporter Directory](https://model.georgia.org/display/exporters/)

## Concordance

The Concordance R-library is the leading process for lookups:
Harmonized System (HS), ISIC/SITC and NAICS


**While R-Language was ultimately not used in our HS pull, you might find this useful**
[How to use R-Language libraries in a Python CoLab (2nd example)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-r-with-google-colaboratory/)
[Our CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1etpn1no8JgeUxwLr_5dBFEbt8sq5wd4v?usp=sharing) for interacting with R from Python - not used here, but you could expand on this.
We ended up NOT using the Concordance R package directly.

Instead we used raw files in the [Concordance GitHub Repo](https://github.com/insongkim/concordance/tree/master/data-raw) as our source for CSV lookup files.
