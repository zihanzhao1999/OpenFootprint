## Fetch Product Data

[Python for our EPD pull](https://github.com/ModelEarth/OpenFootprint/tree/main/products/pull/)<!-- product-footprints.py --> - [Resulting Data](https://github.com/ModelEarth/OpenFootprint/tree/main/products/US)
We're also experimenting with [pulling directly to json](pull/get-json/)

TO DO: Pull csv lists for all states (without cement). Save details as indvidual YAML files. - Yash

June 3, 2024 - <!--Loren -->We copied [product-footprints.py](https://github.com/ModelEarth/OpenFootprint/tree/main/products/pull/) into [Product Footprints Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TJ1fn0-_8EBryN3ih5hZiKLISomOrWDW?usp=sharing)
(We haven't run as CoLab yet.)

For products/pull/product-footprints.py you can set your BuildingTransparency email and password in myconfig.py to call the API.

Active notes are in our Discord group.


## Get API Key for Product Profile YAML

The [Central Concrete EPD data](https://github.com/modelearth/io/blob/master/template/product/product-concrete.yaml) was pulled from the BuildingTransparency.org API using the following steps:  

**STEP 1:** Create an account at [buildingtransparency.org](https://www.buildingtransparency.org/)

**STEP 2:** Use your email and password to get your bearer "key" here in Swagger: [openepd.buildingtransparency.org](https://openepd.buildingtransparency.org) - Click Authorize.

NOTE: Your BuildingTransparency API Key will expire after 3 days. Our python process automatically refreshes the key.

**STEP 3:** Open a command terminal, and get the "Bearer" secret key entering YOUR EMAIL as the username and YOUR PASSWORD.

    curl -X POST -d "{\"username\":\"YOUR EMAIL\",\"password\":\"YOUR PASSWORD\"}" "https://etl-api.cqd.io/api/rest-auth/login" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"


**RETURNS**

~~~
{"key":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","last_login":"2021-08-12T02:49:09.850397Z"}%   
~~~

Which you'll append as:

~~~
-H "Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
~~~

**Example:**

~~~
curl -X 'GET' \
 'https://openepd.buildingtransparency.org/api/epds?page_number=1&page_size=100' \
 -H 'accept: application/json' \
 -H 'filter: {"epds.name":"ASTM International"}' \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
~~~

**Tip:** Use the [EC3 frontend](https://buildingtransparency.org/ec3/material-search) of the tool and watch the commands it issues in the dev inspector's network tab.

# Get YAML for IO Template

[For IO Template](../) - Use OpenEPD swagger

<!-- https://etl-api.cqd.io/ No longer works -->

BuildingTransparency OpenEPD API

Inside Postman, you can load the swagger.yaml file [exported from Swagger](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48525546/how-to-export-swagger-json-or-yaml) which will import the schemas into Postman.
